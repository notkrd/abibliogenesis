# Abibliogenesis

Some new riff on the putative invention of language, systems programming, and John Conway's bombastically titled grid-convolution - austere astonishment, paper itself unfolding - "Game Of Life".

For now, we're just opening the Rust Web Assembly [documentation tutorial (which uses Game of Life as example)](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/implementing.html) and adapting from it into a previous [Game of Life based text of mine](https://taper.badquar.to/2/ohellohi_iliehide.html).
